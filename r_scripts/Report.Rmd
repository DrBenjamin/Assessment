# Introduction, context, and audience

**Note:** *The report builds on the presentation for the management, but looks 
at more factors influencing possible respiratory diseases and adds a country-specific 
view.*

This is data-driven report about respiratory diseases from a physiotherapeutic 
perspective. It is stored in a public [**Github Repository**](https://github.com/DrBenjamin/Assessment). 

The purpose of this report is to show the present audience, Physiotherapists of
the **Good Hope Clinic** in `r CITY`, the **importance of physiotherapeutic 
measures** in cases of respiratory diseases as this health restriction is 
widespread long before COVID-19. For instance, China is facing a 
rise in respiratory diseases after lifting zero-COVID restrictions [@Hawkings].

Another major public health problem is obesity. In view of increasing life expectancy,
the prevalence of obesity is rising steadily in older age groups
[@Jura-Kozak]. @WHO defines overweight as a body mass index (BMI) of
**25** to **29.9 kg/m2** and obesity as a BMI of **30 kg/m2** or higher.
Obesity is a risk factor for many diseases, such as cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer and musculoskeletal diseases. 

Some researchers see a relation between high amount of **abdominal fat** and the 
function of the **respiratory system** [@Rauch]. From policy maker side, there are
initiatives to reduce the occurrence of obesity, for instance Columbia
introduced a tax for fast food [@Daniels].

The aim of this study is to determine the degree of relevance of the topic "Obesity"
for professionals working in the field of physiotherapy with clients that have a
resp. disease.

**Is obesity a risk factor for respiratory diseases?**

# Data wrangling and coding

The data was found on the *Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD)* data repository as on different websites - for instance from *Statista*, 
a global data and business intelligence platform.

The data from OECD shows the total number of **respiratory diseases** per country 
and year. 

```{r code_wrangling1, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}

}
```

On a Github repository data about **air pollution** is available. This data is 
captured for countries and cities of Europe. Several air pollution indicators are 
present. In this report the *PM2.5* (particulate matter with a diameter size of 
2.5 micrometers or smaller) is used.

As the air pollution data is also available per city, it will be filtered by
the `CITY` variable, which is set to `r CITY`, as this report is adopted to
Physiotherapists in a clinic in Milan.

```{r code_wrangling2, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
## Processing air pollution data

  # Reading data

    rename(Country = "Name (latin characters)", PM2.5 = "Yearly PM 2.5 average (µg/m³)", Pop = "Population estimate (GHSL 2020)") %>%
    filter(Year == YEAR) %>%
    select(Country, PM2.5, Pop) %>%
    mutate(Country = Country %>%
      factor())
  
  # Preparing the air pollution data for cities
  air_pollution_cities_data_tidy <- air_pollution_cities_data_raw %>%
  select(Day, `Country code`, "Name (latin characters)", "Daily PM 2.5 average (µg/m³)") %>%
    rename(Code = `Country code`, City = "Name (latin characters)", PM2.5 = "Daily PM 2.5 average (µg/m³)") %>%

  city_pm <- air_pollution_cities_data_tidy %>%
    filter(City == CITY) %>%
    select(PM2.5) %>%

}
```

From a clinical perspective, **overweight and obesity** data is of interest as 
it is a risk factor for many health-related problems. The data taken is available
on the OECD website.

```{r code_wrangling3, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
## Processing overweight / obesity data
{
  # Source: https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/overweight-or-obese-population.htm
  # Reading data
  obesity_data_raw <- read_csv(here("raw_data/", "DP_LIVE_02112023125750641.csv"))
  
  # Eyeballing data
  obesity_data_raw %>% glimpse() # Country names are in a 3-letter country-code format
  obesity_data_raw %>% skimr::skim()
  obesity_data_raw %>% tabyl(LOCATION, TIME, show_na = FALSE) %>% # Shows 2019 the highest number of observations
    adorn_totals("row") %>%
    adorn_percentages("row") %>%
    adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>%
    adorn_ns %>%
    adorn_title %>%
    head(5)
  
  # Preparing the obesity data
  obesity_data_tidy <- obesity_data_raw %>%
    filter(TIME == YEAR) %>%
    select(LOCATION, Value) %>%
    rename(Country = LOCATION) %>%
    group_by(Country) %>%
    # Explain why I used the mean and not dropped the `self_measured` column
    summarise(Value = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(Country = Country %>%
           factor())
}
```

Smoking is a major risk factor for many diseases, as an extensive body of academic
literature and research is showing. Smoking is predominantly associated with the 
etiology of lung cancer and a range of pulmonary diseases. Therefore, data on the 
percentage of smokers in the population are also included in the analysis.

```{r code_wrangling4, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
## Processing smoke data
{
  # Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/433390/individuals-who-currently-smoke-cigarettes-in-european-countries/
  # Reading data 
  smoking_data_raw <- read_csv(here("raw_data/", "statistic_id433390_current-smokers-in-europe-2020-by-country.csv"))
  
  # Eyeballing data
  smoking_data_raw %>% glimpse()
  
  # Preparing the obesity data
  smoking_data_tidy <- smoking_data_raw %>%
    mutate(Country = Country %>%
             factor())
}
```

On the **CIA Factbook**, the index of the *median age*, that summarizes the
age distribution of a population, is distributed. Currently, the median age
per country ranges from a low of about 15 in Niger or Uganda to 45 or more in 
several European countries or Japan. The `Median age` variable can be seen as a 
potential confounder on the correlation between `respiratory diseases` (dependent) 
and other variables like `air pollution` (independent).

```{r code_wrangling5, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
## Processing median age data
{
  # Source: https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/median-age/country-comparison/
  # Reading data
  age_data_raw <- read_csv(here("raw_data/", "cia_factbook_median_age.csv"))
  
  # Eyeballing data
  age_data_raw %>% glimpse()
  
  # Preparing the obesity data
  age_data_tidy <- age_data_raw %>%
    select(name, value) %>%
    rename(Country = name, `Median age` = value) %>%
    mutate(Country = Country %>%
             factor())
  
  # Remove unused data / values from Global Environment
  rm(list = c("air_pollution_data_raw", "obesity_data_raw", "oecd_data_raw", "air_pollution_cities_data_raw", "air_pollution_cities_data_tidy", "smoking_data_raw", "age_data_raw"))
}
```

**Note:** *The different datasets used incompatible encodings for the country 
variable, English language, local language or a code, which lead to the need to
normalize them to a standardized convention. In this case the English naming for
country and continent is chosen.*

As Large Language Models (LLM) are an effective way to automate the processing of
large amounts of text, the OpenAI API is used to convert the country variables in
a consistent matching format. Secondly, the API is used to associate each state 
with its corresponding continental landmass, as this data is missing and needed 
for grouping by continents.

```{r code_wrangling6, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}

**Note:** *If no OpenAI API Key is provided, the code falls back to already stored
data in the repository.*

To prepare the datasets for plotting, it is needed to drop all observations in 
the datasets which are not in the common country list. This is done in the 
following code chunk.

```{r code_wrangling7, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
## Cleaning country descriptions
{
  ## Create dataset `oecd_data_plot`
  # Standardize country names ...
  oecd_plot <- oecd_data_tidy
  for (i in 1:length(unlist(country[1]))) {
    oecd_plot <- oecd_plot %>%
      mutate(Country = if_else(Country == unlist(check[1])[i], unlist(country[1])[i], Country))
  }
  # ... and filter for common countries in datasets
  oecd_plot <- oecd_plot %>%
    filter(Country %in% country_list)
  
  ## Create dataset `air_pollution_plot`
  # Standardize country names ...
  air_pollution_plot <- air_pollution_data_tidy
  for (i in 1:length(unlist(country[2]))) {
    air_pollution_plot <- air_pollution_plot %>%
      mutate(Country = if_else(Country == unlist(check[2])[i], unlist(country[2])[i], Country))
  }
  # ... and filter for common countries in datasets
  air_pollution_plot <- air_pollution_plot %>%
    filter(Country %in% country_list)
  
  ## Create dataset `smoking_data_plot`

  smoking_plot <- smoking_data_tidy
  for (i in 1:length(unlist(country[3]))) {
    smoking_plot <- smoking_plot %>%
      mutate(Country = if_else(Country == unlist(check[3])[i], unlist(country[3])[i], Country))
  }
  # ... and filter for common countries in datasets

  }
  # ... and filter for common countries in datasets

  ## Create dataset `obesity_plot`
  # Standardize country names
  obesity_plot <- obesity_data_tidy
  for (i in 1:length(unlist(country[5]))) {
    obesity_plot <- obesity_plot %>%

  rm(list = c("air_pollution_data_tidy", "obesity_data_tidy", "oecd_data_tidy", "smoking_data_tidy", "i", "check", "country", "country_list", "continent_list"))
}
```

To create the final dataset for plotting, the OECD data about resp. diseases is
enriched with other datasets (`air_pollution`, `obesity`, `smoking` and `age`).

```{r code_wrangling8, echo = TRUE, include = debug_var}
## Preparation of the plotting datasets
{
  ## Combining the datasets
  # Joining OECD data and air pollution data
  data <- left_join(oecd_plot, air_pollution_plot, by = "Country")
  
  # Joining obesity data
  data <- left_join(data, obesity_plot, by = "Country")
  
  # Joining smoking data
  data <- left_join(data, smoking_plot, by = "Country")
  
  # Joining age data
  data <- left_join(data, age_plot, by = "Country")
  
  ## Prepare the dataset for plotting
  # Calculate the diseases per 100.000
  data_plot <- data %>%
    mutate("Diseases of the respiratory system" = `Diseases of the respiratory system` / Pop * 100000) %>%
    rename("Resp. diseases per 100.000" = `Diseases of the respiratory system`) %>%
    rename("Obesity" = Value) %>%
    rename("Smoker" = `Percentage of smokers`)
  
  # Remove unused data / values from Global Environment
  rm(list = c("data", "oecd_plot", "air_pollution_plot", "obesity_plot", "smoking_plot", "age_plot"))
}
```

**Note:** *The data is in a tidy format, meaning each variable is in it's own column 
and each observation in it's own row, and ready for plotting.*

# Data visualisation

After finding the data for `median age`, `smoking`, `obesity / overweight` and `air 
pollution`, it is now set into relation to the `respiratory diseases` variable. 
The following visualizations is proving if there are **correlations** between 
any of them.

**Note:** *The strongest correlation is been found in the independent variable
`Obesity`, towards `Resp. diseases per 100.000`. This could underscore the 
significance of obesity in relation to resp. diseases. `r CITY` has a predicted 
rate of 1688 cases per 100,000, which would be around 23,000 cases for the cities 
population.*

As the data found is restricted to **13 european countries**, the need for a 
global comparison is not achievable. Therefore, the following code will request 
global data on obesity from the `ourworldindata` repository.

In this case, the data does not consist of the percentage of overweight and 
obesity per country, instead it holds the **deaths related to obesity**.

# Discussion and analysis

The data analysis shows a strong correlation (p = 0.07) between the appearance of
overweight / obesity and the risk of developing a respiratory disease. In clinical
experience of Physiotherapists, obesity is known as a critical factor in 
health outcomes of patients. The abdominal fat, is suspected to negatively affect
the mobility and function of the lungs in the upper torso @Rauch. European countries
have a high prevalence of obesity, consequently reducing obesity would serve as 
an initial step towards the diminution of prevalence rates of resp. diseases.

The data also shows moderate correlation between smoking and resp. diseases 
(p = 0.17). This is not surprising, as smoking is known to be a risk factor for a
long time and there are many initiatives to reduce smoking and to prevent younger 
people from starting to consume tobacco.

On the other hand, air pollution and the median age of a country both do not seem
to impact the risk of developing a resp. disease. Particular the air pollution
was under suspicion to be a high risk factor, but the data does not show a significant
correlation.

# Conclusion and Recommendations

As the data shows, obesity leads to a high risk to develop a resp. disease. Countries 
with a higher median age (confounder / mediator) are often found in Europe. 
Physiotherapy is an important pillar in the health system not only to treat 
resp. diseases directly (awareness of breathing movements, postures 
that make breathing easier, stretching positions or mucolytic exercises), but 
also to prevent or cure obesity through physical exercise and diet education. 
@Rauch posits that accumulations of visceral adipose tissue influence the respiratory 
mechanics.

Considering that the factors `air pollution`, `smoking` and `median age`
seemingly exert an insubstantial impact on the risk of developing a resp. disease,
and given that these can not be directly influenced by physiotherapeutic measures, 
it is reasonable to omit them from this conclusion.

Why do factors like *air pollution* and *smoking* not seem to have a strong impact,
as obesity have? Why does obesity have such a strong impact on the risk of developing
a respiratory disease. Can the research of F. X. Mayr, @Rauch referred to his 
foundational work, provide valid explanations for this phenomenon? Will there
be a rise in obesity and also in the prevalence of resp. diseases in Counties which 
are still developing, like on the African continent?

# Reflective practice

**Description:** My experience of working on the project was showing different 
phases of the working process. In the beginning I was very motivated to do the
coding. I used a R script file to try out different data wrangling,
analysis and visualisation methods for the presentation and report and I
was very curious about the data and how I can enrich the OECD data with
data from other sources. This changed over time with more data and aspects 
needed to be covered. The participation in the discussion boards gave me further 
insights, but due to lack of time I was not able to participate in all of the 
discussions.

**Feelings:** At some point with rising complexity, finding the red thread, I was 
a bit overwhelmed. I found it hard to express my thoughts in a structured way,
taking also into account that English is not my native language.

**Evaluation:** I really enjoyed to work with R code, RStudio and plotting 
libraries such as *ggplot2*. Also to use ChatGPT for the first time in R for 
normalizing purposes was a rewarding experience.
The finalization of the project was a bit draining, as it already reached a higher
complexity.

**Analysis:** My time management was good, as after taking my long leave in my 
expiring job, I kept the working hours I had before to finish the 
assessment in good time. With my previous coding experience I found my self in a
good learning position to reach a higher level of understanding in R and data science
at all.

**Conclusion:** Keeping a journal of my steps and thoughts would have helped me to
reach a better understanding of the data and the research question.

**Action plan:** I need to keep the overview of my research question and the data 
which is used. Also I need to be more structured in my approach and follow a red
thread.
